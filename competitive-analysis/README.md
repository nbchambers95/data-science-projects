# Competitive Analysis – Text Analytics

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **natural language processing (NLP)** to analyze and compare customer reviews between two businesses:  
- **Suck It Up Milkshake Co.**  
- **Brushy Mountain Smokehouse and Creamery**

The goal is to identify sentiment trends, key topics, and differences in customer perceptions that can inform business strategy.

## 🔧 Methods & Techniques
- Sentiment Analysis (positive/negative/neutral classification)  
- N-gram Analysis (common word patterns)  
- Topic Modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA)  
- Sarcasm Detection (rule-based indicators)  
- Data Visualization (word clouds, bar charts, sentiment distributions)

## 📊 Key Results
- Sentiment distribution reveals different customer satisfaction patterns between the two competitors.  
- Topic modeling highlights recurring themes (e.g., product quality, service speed, atmosphere).  
- Competitive insights: one brand is perceived as stronger on product quality, while the other is stronger on service.
